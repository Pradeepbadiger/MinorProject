# Curvature Adaptive Headlight System (CAHS)

> ðŸš— *Illuminate Smarter. Drive Safer.*

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Traditional fixed headlights fall short when navigating curves at nightâ€”leaving critical areas in shadow, delaying driver response, and increasing accident risk.  
Our project addresses this by dynamically adjusting headlight direction in real-time based on detected road curvature.

This is achieved through a low-cost, vision-based embedded system that uses real-time video processing and servo-controlled headlight orientationâ€”enhancing road visibility and vehicle safety during night-time turns.

##  Problem Statement

Fixed headlights fail to illuminate curved roads adequately, leading to:
- Blind spots and delayed driver response.
- 25% of fatal night crashes on curves.
- 40% of road edges unlit on bends.
- Increased risk of 4x on curves compared to straight roads.

**Goal:** Create an adaptive headlight system that tracks road curvature and adjusts beam direction using computer vision and embedded control.

##  Objectives

-  Detect lane curvature using real-time computer vision.
-  Adjust headlights dynamically using servo motors.
-  Build a cost-effective and compact prototype.
-  Improve visibility and reduce night-time curve-related crashes.
